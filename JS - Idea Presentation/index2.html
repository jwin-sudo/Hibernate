        <h3>Need for Development</h3>
        <p>OTonight, I will be concerned more with development planning as a tool for shaping and accelerating our development goals. Development planning is a multifaceted and cross-cutting undertaking and it plays an important role in shaping our development goals and priorities.Development planning is about coming up with well-researched and well-reasoned plans that prioritise and synchronise activities, given the scarce resources at our disposal.The aim of any national development plan should therefore be to utilise the available resources more effectively to achieve well-defined objectives.Without a plan that serves as a compass, we are likely to be all over the place and in the process creating unnecessary overlaps and wasting scarce resources. A good plan will guide us to answer questions such as what is to be done; why must it be done; where will it be done; when will it be done; and who will do it. These are important questions to be decided upon in the plan to avoid overlapping and wastage of resources.It is also the case that development planning provides certainty and improves the quality of decision-making process for all parts of government - from national, regional to local governments - and for the private sector.</p>

            <p>Agriculture employs more than half of India's workforce and yet pervasive undernutrition endures, especially among the young. With the long-term goal of building a nutrition knowledge and innovations network in India, this International Food Policy Research Institute programme, provides an information-sharing platform for nutrition, health, agriculture and education stakeholders.The changing climate makes people even more vulnerable. Farmers are struggling to cope in the face of severe droughts and other extreme weather events. Smallholder farmers, women and other vulnerable groups are hit hardest.The solution is to combine traditional agriculture practices with advances in technology and science. Farmers can improve their resilience to the changing climate if they have access to the right knowledge, technologies and market systems. We're working to make agriculture productive for vulnerable groups so that everyone has the chance of a better life.</p>

This "hovercraft" would be attached by a tether to another spacecraft positioned at a gravitationally stable point just a few miles away.We all know the importance of satellite based technology in our daily lives as well as conventional military hard ware. After the cold war the development of satellites and electronic warfare technology enter into force of almost every field of conventional warfare. The usage of satellite technology primarily concerns and tactical advantages based on satellite surveillance, communication affect the opponents in conventional war. The problem of poor visibility or bad weather does not affect satellite weapons such as joint direct munitions (JDAM) and joined stand off weapon (JSOW). These weapons can be deployed in all weather condition without the need of any ground support it works upon GPS.</p>

            <p>Our idea is to reduce harmful consequences of alcohol and other drug use, in order to support students in achieving their personal and academic potential.Learn about campus-wide media campaigns and resources that identify misperceptions about alcohol and other drug behaviors of U-M students.  The goal of these campaigns and resources is to help students minimize negative consequences and enhance their college experience by making informed decisions.Nowadays the trend of alcohol comsumption in university is continuously going up. As a result, the drinking problem has become one of the top concerns about young people. Binge drinking and heavy drinking has become more and more common amoung the university students and that would lead to so many accidents such as aggression, violence, promiscuity, suicide, injury and car accidents. Drinking too much is not just harmful for their physical health but also their mental, psychological and social health, sometimes, it would even influence their whole life. â€œIn fact, in a recent national survey of college At each visit, the study assessed the severity of patient's depression, as well as the frequency and amount of drinking between visits. After 12 weeks in the study, 53% of participants were in remission from their depression. Two thirds or 66% had avoided relapsing into heavy drinking, and 49% totally refrained form drinking during the study. Results showed that any relapse to heavy drinking was associated with reduced likelihood of a depression remission or depressive symptoms.</p>
